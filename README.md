Sticker Collector (first deployed on 2014-04-16)
==========

Sticker Collector was a fun little app I made to help people
collecting Panini Soccer stickers. Users are able to keep track of
the stickers they have and see who of their Facebook friends have the
ones they are missing.

I created this project to learn about the AngularJS framework and REST
Apis. Unexpectedly, I learned a lot about race conditions ;)
I worked with Google App Engine NDB transactions for the first time and
implemented a queue on the front end.
